      <h1 id="whoami">Who am I?</h1>
      <p>
        I am a software developer with a B.S. in Computer Science from Marist College in 2019. I enjoy nature, movies, games, and music.
        When I'm not at work or working on a project, I can usually be found jamming out with my headphones on or watching through
        the Marvel movies for the 30th time.
      </p>

      <h1 id="education">Education</h1>
      <p>I am a graduate of Marist College, where I earned my bachelor's in
        Computer Science with a concentration in Software Development. I also minored in
        Data Science, Mathematics, and Information Systems. Some classes of note that I have taken at Marist College
        include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Design of Compilers</li>
        <li>Operating Systems</li>
        <li>Database Management</li>
        <li>Calculus III</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As a part of the Honors Program at Marist, I also got the opportunity to work one-on-one with
        faculty members on some interesting projects. The first project was a Java-based C4.5 decision tree
        algorithm, my work for which can be found <a href="https://github.com/MichaelInAction/HonorsByContract-C4.5DecisionTree" target=_blank>here</a>.</p>

      <p>For my Honors Senior Thesis, I worked with the same faculty
        member on a project titled "Deployment and Hyperparameter Optimization of Chatbots". My work can be found <a href="https://github.com/MichaelInAction/Senior_Thesis_LSTM_Chatbot" target=_blank>here</a>.
        The work I did on this project was accepted for a presentation at the 21st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in July-August 2019.</p>

      <h1 id="experience">Experience</h1>
      <p>I spent the summer of 2018, as well as the 2018-2019 academic year,
        interning at IBM in Southbury, CT working on Corporate Applications. I learned a lot of valuable skills from this internship, as well
        as many new technologies that I would not have otherwise come into contact with.
        <br>
        <br>
        Outside of academics, I have experience in leadership through Kappa Kappa Psi, an
        honorary band service fraternity. I was elected Secretary of our chapter for the 2017-2018 academic year,
        and I was also elected president of our chapter for the 2018-2019 academic year. This organization
        has given me a lot of good experience in the field of leadership, learning how to effectively
        work in a group setting.</p>

      <h4>Technical</h4>
      <p>As a computer scientist, I have hands on experience with a multitude of
        different languages and technologies. The main languages that I have had experience
        with are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>SQL</li>
        <li>JavaScript/HTML/CSS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I also have done some work with PHP and R.</p>
      <p>Some technologies of note that I have worked with are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>MySQL/PostgreSQL</li>
        <li>Tensorflow/Keras</li>
        <li>Angular</li>
        <li>NodeJS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I have also done a little bit of Android development using Java.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Other</h4>
      <p>From my experience working with my software development team at IBM, I
        developed a strong team-based mindset, and strong collaborative skills.
        I also, from my time working with Kappa Kappa Psi, have gained a lot of leadership
        experience. I worked as secretary to update our attendance system from paper
        to an automated spreadsheet system. As president, I gained a lot of experience in
        managing people, delegating tasks, and working through problems.
